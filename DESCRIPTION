Version: 0.1.0

Author: Björn C. Rall

Description: This package contains several functions I developed aside from my
    analyses of ecological data. I started in December 2021, and I hope it will
    grow through time. This R-Package is my first, and it will also be my first
    open repository on GitHub. If you find issues and bugs, please report them
    to me. I'll try to fix them as fast as I can. I'd also appreciate it if you
    had comments on improving the code in general.
