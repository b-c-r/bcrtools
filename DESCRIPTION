Description: This package includes functions I used while working on scientific
    projects. It includes e.g. a function to select the random structure of
    lme-models. Or because of some changes to the 4th version of R, I wrote a
    wrapper around the read.csv() function automatically converting charaters
    to factors. more ot come ;-).
